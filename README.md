Space Control is a multitrack workstation dedicated to the design, realization, and mixture of spatial gestures for electroacoustic music composition. With its simple interface and minimal learning curve, it makes quick and powerful spatialization available to users of all experience levels.

Features of the software include:
- Spatialization using up to 128 sources and between 4 and 24 output channels
- Real-time playback, metering, and editing
- Offline (faster than realtime) export in multi-mono or interleaved formats
- Virtual mixer for balancing sources in the spatial mix
- Per-source volume automation
- Waveform zoom functionality enabling spatialization on the microsound timescale
- Algorithmic transformations of spatial trajectories
- Bass management option with adjustable subwoofer level and crossover frequency
- Scalable interface with 4 magnification levels
- Ability to save and load user project files

The [Quick Start video](https://youtu.be/hYJ57K_lLjA) demonstrates the basic functionality of the software.

Space Control was created by the team of Professor Jo√£o Pedro Oliveira, acting as project manager, and software developer Raphael Radna. It is a joint project of the UC Santa Barbara Department of Music and the Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE), and was supported by a Faculty Research Grant from the UC Santa Barbara Academic Senate.

Space Control runs on Mac and Windows computers, and is available as a free download from the "Releases" section on the right-hand side of this page.

Note: Some Windows users have reported that their antivirus software blocked important program files when extracting the Space Control distribution. If you encounter problems when running Space Control on Windows, temporarily deactivate any antivirus software and reinstall.
